Carriage Return problem:
- it can be solved by adding \r next to the \n on the std cout calls
- the oflag is the one responsible for the output of the carriage return, but for some reason it doesn't work when the mode
        is set to be non-canonical



Future features to be implemented in the project:

- spawn different spaceships and gliders on the matrix (spawn with g (glider), s (spaceship), S (bigger spaceship))
- add command to terminate the simulation execution (quit with q)
- add command to speed up or down the simulation speed (toggle speed with f)
- add command to pause and resume the simulation (start and stop with s)
- add tutorial prompt at the start of the program, containing information like terminal size and available commands
- allow the user to resize the terminal and then start the initialization of the matrix

- create a better readme file and clean up the repository
- add report and presentation folders, as well as the link to the miosix repository
