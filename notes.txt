Input peripherals:

- analyzing mouse input requires the library linux/input.h, which apparently it is not included under the miosix kernel
-       it can be achieved on the standard linux terminal by using the script base_input_handler and following
        the provided instructions at the start of the file.
-
- analyzing the keyboard input can be done with the termios library, by using the provided code in the base_input_handler file


Programs Structure:

-   base_input_handler.cpp contains the default implementation of the user input handler, provided on stack overflow, written in C
-   input_handler.cpp is a C++ implementation of the same default file provided on stackoverflow
-   MyInput.cpp is a custom keyboard-only user input handler source file, that can be executed via the starter.cpp source file.
            it does not use the poll.h file, nor the input.h file. Handles user input without polling but directly reading the stdin

Carriage Return problem:
- it can be solved by adding \r next to the \n on the std cout calls
- the oflag is the one responsible for the output of the carriage return, but for some reason it doesn't work when the mode
        is set to be non-canonical



sys/poll.h
contains the following data structure used for recording events derived from external peripherals

struct pollfd {
    int fd;			/* File descriptor to poll.  */
    short int events;		/* Types of events poller cares about.  */
    short int revents;		/* Types of events that actually occurred.  */
};


linux/input.h
provides basic functionality for analyzing the mouse input, although it is not currently possible to find the exact
coordinates where the user clicked on the screen. Neither it is possible to know if the click occurred inside the terminal
