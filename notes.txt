Programs Structure:

-   base_input_handler.cpp contains the default implementation of the user input handler, provided on stack overflow, written in C
-   input_handler.cpp is a C++ implementation of the same default file provided on stackoverflow
-   MyInput.cpp is a custom keyboard-only user input handler source file, that can be executed via the starter.cpp source file.
            it does not use the poll.h file, nor the input.h file. Handles user input without polling but directly reading the stdin

Carriage Return problem:
- it can be solved by adding \r next to the \n on the std cout calls
- the oflag is the one responsible for the output of the carriage return, but for some reason it doesn't work when the mode
        is set to be non-canonical



sys/poll.h
contains the following data structure used for recording events derived from external peripherals

struct pollfd {
    int fd;			/* File descriptor to poll.  */
    short int events;		/* Types of events poller cares about.  */
    short int revents;		/* Types of events that actually occurred.  */
};


Future features to be implemented in the project:

- spawn different spaceships and gliders on the matrix (spawn with g (glider), s (spaceship), S (bigger spaceship))
- add command to terminate the simulation execution (quit with q)
- add command to speed up or down the simulation speed (toggle speed with f)
- add command to pause and resume the simulation (start and stop with s)
- add tutorial prompt at the start of the program, containing information like terminal size and available commands
- allow the user to resize the terminal and then start the initialization of the matrix

- create a better readme file and clean up the repository
- add report and presentation folders, as well as the link to the miosix repository
